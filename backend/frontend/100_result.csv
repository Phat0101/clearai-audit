The most accurate classification is 1512.19.00, which is for sunflower oil that is not crude. The statistical code is derived from the tariff data for this classification. An alternative, 1517.90.00, is less appropriate as it pertains to mixtures of oils, whereas this product is a single type of oil.

The classification decision hinges on whether to classify the product based on its primary substance (whey protein, Chapter 35) or its form as a prepared food product (Chapter 21).

The best suggestion is 2106.90.96. Chapter 21 covers 'Miscellaneous edible preparations'. The addition of vanilla flavouring and its presentation as a consumer product (protein powder) makes it a food preparation rather than a raw albuminoidal substance of Chapter 35. Within heading 21.06, the subheading for ""Formulated supplementary sports food"" (as defined in Additional Note 3 to Chapter 21) is the most specific description of the product's nature and intended use.

An alternative is 3502.20.00, which covers 'Milk albumin, including concentrates of two or more whey proteins'. This would be appropriate if the product was considered just the whey protein concentrate itself, but the flavouring makes it a preparation.

A second alternative is 2106.10.10 for 'Protein concentrates'. While correct, the 'Formulated supplementary sports food' description is more specific and therefore preferred under the General Rules of Interpretation.

Within this, subheading 7323.93.00 covers items ""Of stainless steel"".

2.  **3924**: Tableware, kitchenware, other household articles... of plastics.

Heading 39.24 is more appropriate as the containers are described as 'food containers' and 'microwave safe,' which points to their use as durable, reusable kitchenware for domestic food storage and preparation.

Within heading 39.24, subheading **3924.10.00** specifically covers 'Tableware and kitchenware'. This is the most accurate description for the goods.

An alternative is 39.23.10.90 if the items are considered primarily for 'packing' goods, but their nature as reusable household items makes 39.24 the better fit. Another alternative is under 3924.90.00 as 'other household articles'."

    *   **Active Ingredient:** Bleach, typically sodium hypochlorite.

2.  **Tariff Chapter Evaluation:**
    *   **Chapter 38 (Miscellaneous chemical products):** Heading 38.08 explicitly covers ""disinfectants and similar products, put up in forms or packings for retail sale"". The subheading 3808.94 is for disinfectants. This is the most specific description.
    *   **Chapter 34 (Soap, organic surface-active agents, washing preparations...):** Heading 34.02 covers cleaning preparations. While a disinfectant cleans, its primary function is disinfection. According to the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System, the most specific heading is preferred. Heading 38.08 is more specific than 34.02.
    *   **Chapter 28 (Inorganic chemicals...):** Heading 28.28 covers hypochlorites (the chemical in bleach). However, Chapter 28 notes exclude preparations put up for retail sale that are more specifically described elsewhere. As this product is a formulated disinfectant for retail sale, it is excluded from Chapter 28 and classified in Chapter 38.

3.  **Code Selection:**
    *   **Best Suggestion (3808.94.00 / 56):** This code directly covers ""Disinfectants"" that are not specified elsewhere in the heading. The product's primary function is as a disinfectant, and it is packed for retail sale.
    *   **Alternative 1 (3402.50.00 / 20):** This is for ""Preparations put up for retail sale"" in liquid form under the general heading for cleaning preparations. It is a viable alternative but less specific than 3808.94.00.
    *   **Alternative 2 (2828.90.00 / 15):** This code covers sodium hypochlorite. It is the least likely option as the product is a formulated preparation for a specific use (disinfecting) and put up for retail, not just the base chemical.

1.  **Product Analysis**: The key characteristics are that it is a solid-state, non-volatile, portable electronic storage device with a USB interface.

2.  **Tariff Chapter Selection**: The most relevant tariff heading is 8523, which covers ""Discs, tapes, solid-state non-volatile storage devices, “smart cards” and other media for the recording of sound or of other phenomena..."". This is more specific than other potential headings, such as 8471 for computer parts.

3.  **Code Lookup & Justification**:
    *   Chapter 85, Note 6(a) defines ""Solid-state non-volatile storage devices"" as devices with a connecting socket and flash memory, which accurately describes a USB flash drive.
    *   The `tariff_chapter_lookup` for heading 8523 confirms that subheading `8523.51.00` is specifically for ""Solid-state non-volatile storage devices"". This is the most precise classification for a USB flash drive.
    *   The corresponding statistical code for this HS code is `50`.
    *   The lookup data does not indicate any available Tariff Concession Orders for this code.

4.  **Alternatives**:
    *   `85235900` (stat code `95`) is a plausible alternative, covering ""Other"" semiconductor media if the device were not considered to fit the specific definition of 8523.51.00.
    *   `85238000` (stat code `31`) is a broader ""Other"" category within the 8523 heading, serving as a more general alternative.

5.  **Conclusion**: The best classification is 85235100 / 50 due to the highly specific description in the tariff schedule and its corresponding notes."

2.  **Tariff Chapter Selection**: Chapter 63 covers 'Other made up textile articles'. Within this, heading 6302 is for 'Bed linen, table linen, toilet linen and kitchen linen'. This is the most appropriate heading.

3.  **Code Shortlisting**: The tariff lookup for 6302 provides several options.
    *   `6302.31.00` covers 'Other bed linen: Of cotton'. As the item is a white (not printed) cotton duvet cover, this is the correct 6-digit code.
    *   Within this code, the statistical code `04` is for '.Quiltcovers'.

4.  **Final Recommendation**:
    *   **Best Suggestion**: `63023100` with statistical code `04` is the most precise classification.
    *   **Alternative 1**: `63022100` with statistical code `04`. This would apply if the duvet cover were printed.
    *   **Alternative 2**: `63023100` with statistical code `01`. This would be correct if the duvet cover were imported as part of a set (e.g., with pillowcases).

1.  **Product Analysis**:
    *   **Material**: The material is not specified, but cycling gloves are typically made from a combination of materials, including synthetic textiles (like polyester, nylon, spandex) and potentially leather or synthetic leather. The ""gel padded"" feature is a key characteristic.
    *   **Form**: Gloves.
    *   **Function**: To be worn on the hands for protection, comfort, and grip while cycling.
    *   **Use**: A sporting accessory.

2.  **Shortlisted Tariff Chapters**:
    *   **Chapter 42 (Articles of leather)**: Considered if the gloves are primarily leather or if leather provides the essential character. Heading 4203 covers leather gloves, including those for sport.
    *   **Chapter 61 (Articles of apparel... knitted or crocheted)**: Considered if the gloves are primarily made of knitted textile fabrics. Heading 6116 covers knitted gloves.
    *   **Chapter 62 (Articles of apparel... not knitted or crocheted)**: Considered if the gloves are primarily made of woven textile fabrics. Heading 6216 covers woven gloves.

3.  **Reasoning for Classification**:
    Without a definitive material composition, classification must be based on the most likely construction. Modern cycling gloves often use a mix of materials. However, many are made predominantly of woven synthetic fabrics for durability and breathability, with gel pads integrated for comfort.

    *   **Best Suggestion (62160000 32)**: This code is for ""Gloves, mittens and mitts"" under Chapter 62, which covers articles of apparel that are *not* knitted or crocheted. This is a broad and appropriate classification for gloves made of common woven synthetic materials used in sportswear. It is chosen as the best fit due to its simplicity and applicability to a wide range of modern textile-based sports gloves.

    *   **Alternative 1 (61169300 14)**: This code is for gloves made of knitted or crocheted synthetic fibres. Many cycling gloves feature a stretchy, breathable back made of knitted fabric. If this component defines the essential character or is the predominant material, this heading would be appropriate.

    *   **Alternative 2 (42032190 92)**: This code is for leather gloves ""Specially designed for use in sports"" (other than golf). This would be the correct classification if the gloves were made of leather or if a leather/composition leather palm was determined to give the gloves their essential character.

    Given the ambiguity, the most general and likely classification for modern textile-based cycling gloves is chosen as the primary recommendation."

The primary function of the goods dictates their classification.

Chapter 95 of the Tariff covers ""Toys, games and sports requisites"". Heading 9506 includes ""Articles and equipment for general physical exercise, gymnastics, athletics..."". The most specific and appropriate classification for dumbbells falls under subheading 9506.91.00 as ""Articles and equipment for general physical exercise, gymnastics or athletics"".

An alternative classification in Chapter 73, which covers articles of iron or steel, is considered but ultimately incorrect. Section XV, Note 1(l) explicitly excludes articles of Chapter 95 from being classified as articles of base metal. Therefore, classification by function in Chapter 95 takes precedence over classification by material in Chapter 73.

The best fit is 9506.91.00 with statistical code 31. An alternative is the less specific residual code 9506.99.90 / 32 for 'Other' sports equipment."

Specifically, heading 9506 covers 'Articles and equipment for general physical exercise, gymnastics, athletics...'. The exclusion notes in Chapter 40 (Note 2(f)) and Chapter 39 (Note 2(y)) explicitly state that articles of Chapter 95 are excluded, meaning the classification must be under Chapter 95 rather than by the material (latex rubber or plastic). The most appropriate subheading is 9506.91.00 as 'Articles and equipment for general physical exercise, gymnastics or athletics'. The associated statistical code is 31. This classification has a Tariff Concession Order available."

As the backpack has a capacity of 40 litres, it falls under the statistical code 40 for goods with a capacity of 30L or more. Alternative classifications consider different materials (4202.91.90 for leather) or a broader container category (4202.12.90)."

The principal function of this device is to convert stored DC electricity into usable AC/DC power, which is the function of a static converter under heading 8504. The item does not meet the specific descriptions in 8504.40.30, so it falls under 8504.40.90 (Other). Within this subheading, statistical code 83 (Other) is most appropriate as the item is a complex power station, not merely a simple power supply unit. Alternative classification 8507.60.00 is plausible if the energy storage (the lithium-ion accumulator) is considered the principal function, as per Chapter Note 3 to Chapter 85. A second alternative, 8504.40.90 with statistical code 73, is also provided, as it correctly identifies the power handling capacity of over 25W."

Therefore, the most accurate classification is 2711.13.10. An alternative classification in Chapter 36 is considered, but Note 2(b) to Chapter 36 restricts its application to liquefied gas fuels in containers not exceeding 300 cm³ for filling lighters. A 220g butane canister has a volume of approximately 384 cm³, thus excluding it from Chapter 36. The suggested alternatives account for similar products like propane or other liquefied petroleum gases."
